        <p>Iâ€™m James and I'm student at Manchester Codes on the Software Engineer FastTrack programme. 
            I originally started my career in broadcasting before being bitten by the tech bug and making 
            the jump into a career in tech. My current role is a test engineer as part of a software engineering 
            team, prior to this I have worked in other tech roles including operations engineer and systems engineer.</p>
